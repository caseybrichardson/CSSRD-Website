            The ACM student chapter at the University of Texas Pan-American (UTPA) would like to welcome you to our Ninth Annual Computer Science Student Research Day Conference. This event will bring together Computer Science students from various universities doing research, faculty members from diverse fields, and company representatives, all in order to collaborate and promote Computer Science research and projects that are relevant to business and industry entities in our community.
          </p>

            The Computer Science department is excited to host this event for the Ninth time and hopes that all entities involved enjoy their visit to UTPA and are able to further their knowledge on research being done in the Computer Science field, not only from the Rio Grande Valley, but from surrounding areas and foreign universities.
