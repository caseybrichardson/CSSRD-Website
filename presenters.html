              This project consists of the development of an Android application to help the users find gas stations along their travel route.  The main purpose of this application is to help the user save time and money by finding the gas station with the lowest price along their travel routes.  This application would be a great resource for low income families and anyone who would like to save both money and time.  Gas $mart uses the Google Android Maps V2 API to retrieve maps and directions.  It also makes use of the myGasFeed API to obtain information on gas stations and their fuel prices.  The application takes a destination input from the user and the preferences set by the user to formulate queries.  It queries the mapping information using the Google Android Maps V2 API and renders the map based the on the user’s current location.  The myGasFeed API is used to query information on gas stations located along the route based geographical points obtained from Google Maps.  An algorithm will sort and select the best gas stations options to present them to the user.  Once the user selects one of the options the application will update the route to direct the user to the selected gas station and it will then redirect the user back to the original travel route.

              There are many applications today that allow businesses to manage workflow and workload distributions. The problem is that these are mainly done manually with little to no optimization. This project will develop a system in which businesses that require going out to locations have a way to allocate work orders in an efficient manner given the metric of distance and time. This allocation should be able to be done on a one by one basis or on a massive scale and at the same time balance work load time for each available employee. The system should also be flexible enough to fit the needs of a variety of business types.

              The Nubot Model is a computational model of active self-assembly for studying the complexity of self-assembled structures. It can be thought of as a growing cellular automaton, where rules are applied nondeterministically and asynchronously. What distinguishes this model from others is the addition of a rule type that allows units to move relative to each other, applied locally but propagating the movement throughout the configuration, allowing for efficient growth of algorithmically assembled structures without external direction. To effectively analyze the complexity of these assemblies, we must be able to simulate a nubot environment, design and edit configurations, and produce large sets of rules, all with minimal difficulty.

              We are developing a set of visual tools that will streamline the process of creating configurations, generating rulesets, and then simulating the system that incorporates them in a user-controlled virtual environment: Our tools will allow the user to “paint” the assembly units on a grid with states and bonds, automatically generate a list of primitive rules from a given input, and encode lengthy videos of a simulation.

              My project is a turn-based battle game where the player must traverse a map with a grid layout to reach an end goal. The player deals with obstacles to reach the goal such as enemies (monsters) that the player will enter turn-based combat with upon running into them. Often in this sort of game, enemies would appear in random encounters, fixed positions, or wander in scripted movements. This game will feature monster behavior that will adapt in response to the player's actions as the game is being played. The question I ask myself and wish to answer with this project is "Does changing monster behavior make this turn-based battle game more enjoyable?"

              The battle system uses statistics (Level, Hit Points, Attack, etc.) that increase as the player succeeds in combat. Monster behavior is based on the probability of three reactions occurring: chase the player, run from the player, or move randomly. The probability of each constantly adapts during the game in response to the player’s actions. The player’s Level and the number of monsters defeated changes the probability of the three reactions, making them either more likely or less likely to happen.

              This project applies a variation to a game that utilizes a turn-based battle system, providing adaptive enemy behavior. Using behavior based on probability makes enemies less predictable and therefore more challenging. I believe the final product with the monsters behaving as intended should be more enjoyable to players. Monsters that can run in fear or rush to attack will be found more entertaining and challenging than monsters with random/scripted movements, or static positions.

              Computer architecture is a very important discipline in computer engineering and computer science. It is important enough that it is currently included in the majority of computer science and computer engineering university programs. Computer architecture is however not a subject that can be easily digested by students. It is for this reason that computer architecture instructors have relied on a variety of interactive teaching methods such as the use of CPU simulation programs in order to give students a greater understanding of the material offered in computer architecture courses. 

              Many CPU simulation programs have been developed for most of the instruction set architectures that exist, be they RISC or CISC architectures. However, a major trend observed is that they follow a simplistic input-output approach. This means that the user provides an input program, the simulator processes it and executes it, and finally the user is provided with merely a “final picture” of the contents of the various components of the CPU such as memory and registers. This approach fails to let the user see what happens in between the input-feeding and output-receiving phases. On this talk, a software development project for a MIPS-Based CPU Simulation Software to address such failure is presented. The project’s current progress, a simple prototype, and future work will also be discussed. 

              The goal of the MIPS-Based CPU Simulation Software is to provide the user with a graphic visualization of what goes on inside a MIPS-based CPU every time a MIPS assembly language instruction is inputted. The proposed simulator will not only graphically display the data path of each instruction via animations but also make changes to the various CPU components in real time and visually.

              Sensor hardware are integrated in mobile devices that help automate or make our daily tasks much easier to carry out. The sensor hardware integrated in mobile devices are accelerometer, gyroscope, magnometer and barometer. The accelerometer helps in detecting the orientation of the phone and gyroscope help in tracking rotation and twist and linear acceleration of movement. For this project we will focus on the accelerometer and gyroscope only. These sensors make it possible to create an interface screen that will lock an image or object in its current position, while continuing movement or rotation on the phone in any direction desired. By using the sensors we can acquire the x, y, z coordinates of the phone and image’s origin in its current state. This values help carry out a calculus 3 based mathematical computation with vectors and angles in 2D and 3D space. These computations calculate the transformations the object is going through in order to keep the object or image from decreasing in size, as the phone is going through movement or rotation. In this poster, we demonstrate how these calculations can keep the image stay in its current position without changing in size.

              Our project is developing brain computer interfaces (BCI) using a neuroheadset to establish direct communication between the human brain and a computer. We are using the Emotiv EEG headset to collect human thought as brain waves. Using training algorithms, we detect patterns in the brainwaves and map the brainwaves onto commands in a computer application. We are focusing on two different applications where users explicitly manipulate their brain activity rather than use motor movements to accomplish tasks. The first is a biometric user authentication application. After training on a series of images, the signature brainwaves patterns are stored for the user. During a 2 pass authentication, the user is allowed access after they have entered a standard keyboard password and they are able to replicate their signature brainwave pattern for a series of images. The use of this biometric authentication in a two factor system strengthens the identification process. The second application involves interactions in a 3D immersive environment. After the user trains the application on commands, the user is then able to interact with and control a model. This can be used to create training data for use with other devices, such as a robotic arm.

              Recent advances in BCI research have allowed this extension of the traditional human computer interactions model. However, the focus of these advances has been on improving the quality of life for individuals with physical disabilities. There are currently no publicly available BCI applications which target authentication or activity in an immersive environment. Our applications will increase the awareness and possibilities of BCI applications using EEG devices.

              The Museum of South Texas History (MOSTHistory) requested the help of the UT Pan American Computer Science department to build a new system to help manage their tour and outreach reservations.  The museum’s current reservation software, VisitMaker, is old age and no longer supported.  In addition, Visitmaker does not take advantage of concurrency in today’s windowed environments or provide mechanisms to interface with other running applications. 
              
              The approach used to complete this project was the Waterfall Methodology.  All stakeholders were interviewed and business processes were analyzed in order to gather the proper requirements for a new software system. During the requirements elicitation process, it was discovered that the MOSTHistory rental and event reservations processes were completed manually. There was a determination made that it was important to keep all existing data available through Visitmaker.  A Requirements Analysis Document (RAD) was generated.
              
              A non-functioning prototype was built to help assess the correctness of the identified functional and non-functional requirements. The decision was made to fully replicate Visitmaker’s database in the new system to facilitate the migration of all existing data for archival purposes. Due to enhancement in functionality, new schemas were added to the overall database structure. 
              
              New functionality of the system includes the ability to save and print confirmation letters as Word documents or reports as Excel spreadsheets, the ability of directly emailing confirmation letter and reports from within the system and finally system to system communication with the LO calendar application, automatically updating reservations as they are created and modified. Additional functionality was identified, but implementation was deferred to a future version. This included public access to request and or create a reservation for a tour or event.
              
              This new software will be beneficial to MOSTHistory because it will create newer, faster, and more reliable ways to manage and appropriately disseminate reservation information to departments. This will reduce errors in data collection as well as reduce human to human communication of data.  It will create a smoother workflow and there will be faster information transfer to crucial departments like bookkeeping and Human Resources. The project will improve overall customer service at the MOSTHistory.

                In the growing world of online transactions, many people have become concerned with their information being secure. There are many ways to go about protecting information online with the most widely used implementation being strong encryption algorithms. Encryption allows for a secure way for two parties to talk by using a secret passphrase to determine whether or not the person asking for the information is in fact the right person. For this design I have chosen to focus primarily on the AES or Advanced Encryption Standard algorithm to show how encryption works as well as how it can be implemented in a website server. One of the main points for this design will be to show how the data is stored in a database. The data itself will not be stored in plaintext but rather in what’s known as ciphertext meaning that the data is encrypted. The reason why the data itself will be encrypted is so that if the integrity of the website is breached, then what is stored in the database it will still be unreadable unless the attacker has the key for the algorithm. In addition to that, the site itself will be running an HTTPS or Hyptertext Transfer Protocol Secure which uses another form of an encryption algorithm to securely protect the traffic from the website itself.
                
                The presentation will consist of two things: A powerpoint detailing the main properties of AES as well as how the algorithm goes about encrypting the data. This will show all of the steps the algorithm takes as well as show how the data becomes ciphertext. In addition to the powerpoint will be a short demonstration of the algorithm in action showing how the algorithm both encrypts and decrypts data on a mock website.

              The DBLP is a computer science bibliography website that lists over two million research articles on computer science, information sciences and information technology.  Despite the impressive amount of articles, the DBLP website provides only limited search capabilities.  Although there are some existing systems which offer more robust querying capabilities, there are no systems which provide specific analysis of research production of university computer science departments.  To address this issue, we design and develop an XML database that imports the DBLP publication dataset in XML format and features a web-based interface with more expressive querying, analyzing and reporting capabilities.  
              
              My system will take query information from the user and use it to automatically generate XQuery queries so the user can retrieve information from the database.  After receiving article information from a specific university, this data is then broken up and analyzed for key terms to find out which CS topics are researched more frequently.  Since titles of articles usually contain information of the topics being covered, we can compose an analysis of a CS department’s research trends.  After compiling a list of these trends, the data is then used to create visualizations to facilitate data analysis.
              
              The goal of this system is to produce analysis of research production trends which can be useful to university CS departments for reasons such as using it to discover which topics their research focuses on, to create analysis reports of their research production, and it can be useful when hiring new faculty.  Because my system focuses on querying information of authors from specific universities, my system provides a unique experience that other computer science bibliography-querying systems do not offer.

              An Electronic Recording (E-Recording) system is used to send and receive real property records to County Clerks across the nation. The creation of this system has allowed customers to record documents with shorter turn-around time and less overhead. LandtitleUSA currently provides an E-Recording gateway that allows customers to submit documents to numerous counties across Texas. This system, although functional, has some drawbacks which make E-recording frustrating for both customers and support staff.
              
              The currently operating E-Recording system has many deficiencies that make the creation of a new E-Recording system necessary. Some of these deficiencies include old and hard to edit code, system breaking bugs, no direct county integration, and time consuming support. These shortfalls along with others makes the creation of a new E-Recording system viable.
              
              This project is broken up into three phases. The database creation and conversion, the E-recording county request and response handler, and the customer front end. The database creation and conversion phase involves creating a new database that addresses the shortcomings of the original database. This includes database normalization, adhering to the Property Records Industry Association (PRIA) version 2.4 standards, and better relational mapping to help create a dynamic environment for customers. 
              
              The next phase of the project is the creation of the county request and response handler. This service facilitates the transfer of documents between the customers and the counties. This service uses XML Schema Definition (XSD) files provided by the county and Java Architecture for XML Binding (JAXB) to create transaction requests and responses. This service generates an Extensible Markup Language (XML) file based on the requirements of the county and the information provided by the customer. It also translates and inserts response XML files into the E-Recording database.
              
              Phase three is the creation of a customer front end. The front end will allow customers create E-Recording packages, add required information, submit and receive documents, and check on the status of the current packages. The customer front end follows a Model-view-controller (MVC) approach and is built with Java Server Pages (JSP) and Spring Framework. This allows users to quickly and easily receive and update information, and makes updating and adding code much more manageable.
              
              By implementing this new E-Recording system, it will allow us to more easily support customers, increase revenue by submitting directly to counties, have much more manageable code, and allow for more frequent updates.
